Make people think differently.
Change the world with software.
Amaze us with what you can do.

ThoughtWorks isn’t your average company, so we don’t hire average people. We hire those who want to address challenging problems and explore new domains alongside equally intelligent and principled people.

We’re a global IT consulting firm with over 2,000 employees on six continents with no plans of stopping. We’ve made a name for ourselves during our 20 years of business. Our clients know that we’ll deliver amazing custom software and that we’ll never compromise on excellence. As we grow, we take extreme care to preserve our culture and the excitement of being a ThoughtWorker.
 
We’re more than just a consultancy — we’re a social community in which each individual brings a curiosity and passion for technology. The kind that makes learning 11 technologies in a week or writing an ant file from memory seem more like fun than work.  This community thrives on continual learning, teaching, and knowledge sharing, so we’ve implemented a “no jerks allowed” policy. This is where YOU come in.
 
Our Associate Consultant program is a 24-month period of well-supported training and staffing out of either our Chicago, Dallas or San Francisco office. Associate Consultants have the opportunity to travel all over the country and gain unparalleled experience on client sites. But, first things first -- the Associate Consultant program begins with new ThoughtWorkers from all over the world gathering in India for ThoughtWorks University, a five-week training course. Those five weeks are devoted to a project simulation that prepares you for a delivery role on a real client project. Developers are immersed in an OO programming bootcamp, Quality Analysts are trained in agile testing, and everyone learns how to work collaboratively. Imagine discussing computability theory over fresh samosas then returning to the US as a ThoughtWorks consultant with international connections.
 
As an Associate Consultant, you’ll get to:

• Work alongside incredibly talented developers
• Tackle business-critical problems with custom-designed, multi-tier applications using a wide range of the very latest technologies
• Work in Agile, Lean, and Continuous Development best practices
• Work in an informal, collaborative, transparent, non-hierarchal, ego-free culture where your talent is valued over a role title
• Kick-start your career outside of the confinements of a traditional career path – one which focuses on your strengths rather than a predetermined one-size-fits-all plan
• Shape the future of ThoughtWorks by leading and/or contributing to communities within ThoughtWorks
• Freely voice your ideas and views as part of continuous open and passionate debate on every topic from the merits of Coffee Script to Cucumber
• Be a part of an organization that is as committed to social responsibility as it is to technology and innovation
